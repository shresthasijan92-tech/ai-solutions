# **App Name**: AISolutions Hub Showcase

## Core Features:

- Homepage Content Highlighting: Dynamically display featured content (Services, Projects, Blog, Gallery, Events) with links to dedicated pages.  The admin gets to control what's featured, so an AI "tool" uses that selection to suggest what the best representation on the homepage could be for that choice.  
- Contact Form Submission: Implement a functional contact form with validation and submission handling, notifying the administrators.
- Feedback Submission and Testimonial Display: Collect user feedback and ratings, display approved testimonials; form submissions require valid email.
- Services Catalog: Filterable/searchable listing of services with descriptions, icons, benefits, and prices.
- Project Portfolio: Display projects with images, titles, descriptions, and technologies in a filterable/searchable portfolio.
- Blog Articles: Showcase blog articles with images, titles, excerpts, and publication dates, filterable/searchable.
- Admin Content Management: CRUD interface to manage services, projects, articles, gallery items, events, careers, and feedback.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Golden Amber (#E09F3F) to capture attention, adding vibrance to a desaturated site without the use of orange.
- Background color: Light gray (#E5E7EB), a very pale desaturated near-tone of the Golden Amber.
- Accent color: Burnt Sienna (#8E2905), used selectively to emphasize actions and highlight critical elements.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Consistent use of simple, professional icons from a ShadCN UI-compatible library.
- Use of Tailwind CSS grid and flexbox for a responsive and clean layout.
- Subtle, professional animations for transitions and interactions to enhance user experience.
